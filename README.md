**NOTE** *This software is work-in-progress (which explains its rather basic visual appearance)*

## SSH Key Portal

The SSH Key Portal is a modified version of the demo
[AARC VO Portal](http://github.com/rcauth-eu/aarc-vo-portal).
It provides a user interface for the SSH public key upload API from the
[AARC Master Portal](http://github.com/rcauth-eu/aarc-master-portal).

## Building

In case you wish the build the SSH Key Portal you should first build two of its
dependencies in the following order

1. [security-lib](https://github.com/rcauth-eu/security-lib)
2. [OA4MP](https://github.com/rcauth-eu/OA4MP)
